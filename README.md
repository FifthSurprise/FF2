## Background

FF2 (ForgetForgetting2) solves the problem of tracking memorization of large amounts of data for studying.

## Features

Users can create and share stacks of cards.  FF2 tracks how well the user was able to recall the information on the card and knows when to quiz the user again.

In addition, each card is markdown compatible allowing for images and markdown text.  Stacks can be loaded from a gist at github.

## Usage

Users sign up for an account and then add stacks of cards to their library to study.  When studying a card, the user in their head guesses the answer and then flips over the card (via hover).  Then the user rates how well they knew the answer.  The application handles when they should try studying the card again.

## Development/Contribution

Contribution can be through additional study content.  Also there are raised enhancements which swould be useful to have.

## Future
-  Improving stability and speed of the application
-  Allow users to make customizations to cards they are studying.  This will be useful for interview questions where each user has their own version of the answer.
-  Allow updating stacks of cards from gist.github.com
-  Improve data destruction.
